# Advent of Code 2022

[Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022/about) - Dart edition. I'm
solving these challenges in my spare time, under the motto of "if it works, and
if the result is correct, it's fine by me". Solutions are grouped into days. For
each day there's a test and "real" input. Code is sorted into parts; there are
two parts per day.

I'm not going to document what my code does, as I want you to read through the
tasks on your own. The stories are fascinating, and I'm sure they'll bring a
smile to your face. Or two. The more the merrier!

## Usage

Make sure you have Dart installed on your system. Next, get dependencies. Now,
you can do two things:

1. Run package executable file: this prints out solutions to all problems, day
   by day, into the console with some lovely additional info on what in the Santa's beard you're looking at.
2. Run the test suite, which is what I'm using during development on test data
   to verify my solutions work before submitting them.

```bash
# Christmas-based output
dart run

# Run test suite
dart test
```

## Personal note

For many of us, December is the time of the year we where gather around with our
families and loved ones. Make sure you spend quality time with them. To everyone
out there reading this, take care and stay safe. The world needs you.

On that note, also remember that some people are sadly not as fortunate. If you
can, and if you want to, consider donating to charity.

And for the first time in my life, I'll end README with an emoji. Merry Christmas
and a Happy New Year ❤️
